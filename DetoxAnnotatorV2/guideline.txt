## 📝 **Annotation Guidelines for Evaluating Detoxification and Style Transfer**

### **Objective:**
You are evaluating the output of two models that rewrite toxic or non-toxic comments. Each output aims to:
1. **Remove toxicity (detoxification)**.
2. **Preserve the original meaning and personal writing style**.
3. **Match a target writing style**: **Formal**, **Neutral**, or **Friendly**.

---

### 🔍 **What You'll See**

For each task, you’ll get:
- The **original comment** (which may be toxic or non-toxic).
- Two **rewritten outputs** (from two different models).
- A **target style** (Formal, Neutral, or Friendly).

---

## ✅ **Your Task as Annotator**

For **each rewritten comment**, assign **ONE overall rating** from **A to E**, based on the combined quality across the following 4 aspects:

### 1. **Meaning Preservation**
- How well does the rewritten comment keep the same **core meaning and message**?

### 2. **Original Writing Style Preservation**
- Does the new version reflect the **tone, voice, or phrasing style** of the original?
- Think about the writer’s **personal tone**, not the target style.

### 3. **Detoxification Quality**
- Is the rewritten comment **free from offensive, toxic, or harmful language**?
- If detoxification was not possible without changing the meaning, was it **handled gracefully**?

### 4. **Target Style Accuracy**
- Does the output match the requested tone:  
  - **Formal** = professional, respectful, and grammatically correct  
  - **Neutral** = balanced, factual, emotionally restrained  
  - **Friendly** = warm, conversational, inviting

## 🅰️-🅴️ **Rating Scale (Combined Score)**

| **Rating** | **What It Means (Across All 4 Aspects)** |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **A**      | Excellent: Detoxified, meaning and original style preserved, and matches the target style perfectly. |
| **B**      | Good: Mostly successful, with minor issues in one area (e.g., slight style shift or wording change). |
| **C**      | Fair: Adequate attempt, but moderate issues in meaning, style, detoxification, or target tone. |
| **D**      | Poor: Major flaws in meaning or tone, or detoxification is incomplete or overdone. |
| **E**      | Very Poor: Meaning is lost, toxic content remains, or the output ignores the target style entirely. |

## ✍️ **Comment Box (Optional but Helpful)**

Use this to explain:
- Why you gave the score you did
- If the model **sacrificed meaning to detoxify**
- If the output felt unnatural or robotic
- If the original style was lost or changed too much

---

### 🧪 **Example Task**

**Original Comment:**  
> "You're a moron. Nobody wants to hear your nonsense."

**Target Style:** **Formal**

**Model Output:**  
> "Your contributions are not constructive and could be more respectful."

**Example Rating: A**  
- ✅ Meaning is preserved  
- ✅ Toxicity is gone  
- ✅ Tone is formal  
- ✅ Still sounds a bit like the original speaker (blunt but now polite)

### 💡 Final Tips for Annotators

- Balance **detoxification** with **semantic and stylistic preservation**.
- Don’t over-penalize if style had to shift *slightly* for tone or clarity.
- Use your best judgment — you’re helping us improve real-world AI behavior.
